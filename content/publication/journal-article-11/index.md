abstract: The emergence and re-emergence of infectious diseases has been a
global cause of concern in the past few decades. Previous research in
the field has revealed that human connectivity and mobility behaviour
play a major role in the spreading of an infectious disease. In this
work, we propose multi-patch models that take into account the effects of human mobility on the evolution of disease dynamics in a multipopulation environment. In particular, we develop SEIRS multi-patch
and multi-group epidemic models, extending the work of [1] and [2] to
practically account for distinct epidemiological-status-dependent mobilities in each patch. We rigorously show that the disease free equilibria
(DFE) for both models are stable when R0 â‰¤ 1. We also prove
that the models have a unique endemic asymptotically stable equilibrium when R0 > 1. We also introduce new local reproduction
numbers from the point of view of the sub populations, and establish some important relation between them and the global reproduction
number. Various numerical simulations are conducted to study the
effects of mobility and the residence time matrix on the evolution
of the disease in individual patches and the overall environment.
