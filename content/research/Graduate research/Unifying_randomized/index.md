## Major Activities
#### Randomized Inverse Problems
We have developed a unified framework under which we can study and understand
randomized approaches to solving inverse problems. We show that this 
various randomized approach to solving inverse problems can be viewed
as special cases of this more general framework. In particular, we prove
asymptotic convergence results for a broad class of randomizations using 
stochastic optimization theory. Our unified framework not only recovers many existing methods (including gradient descent, coordinate descent, Karzmarz method, etc) but also discovers new ones.

#### Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) through the lens of duality
The EnKF for inverse problems can be viewed as a special case of the randomized right sketching algorithm. Due to the randomization of the covariance matrix (Regularization) involved, the right sketching algorithm often yields poor results as evident from the Figure below. Therefore, iterative versions of the EnKF is often employed for higher estimation accuracy. We take a new look at the Ensemble Kalman Filter through the lens
of duality. In particular, we show that by dealing with a randomized Lagrangian dual function, the estimation equations as well as asymptotic/non asymptotic convergence results can be derived for the EnKF.  Furthermore, we show that such an interpretation allows one to design improved EnKF algorithms for finding the inverse solution which converges faster.

## Significant Results


#### Randomized Inverse Problems
We analyze numerically the advantages of sketching the forward map 
from the left compared to sketching from the right and compare results.
For the Shaw problem (*P.C. Hansen, Regularization tools version 4.0*), 
we see that the randomized MAP (Wang, Bui-Thanh, Ghattas) and 
left sketching approaches perform well with few samples while right sketching 
performs poorly. We study this phenomenon from the viewpoint of regularization.
