I graduated with my bachelors in physics from UT Austin in 2024. During my bachelor's degree, I worked on Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and its demonstration in black hole perturbation simulation. Currently, I am exploring different research topics in deep learning, optimization, and 3D reconstruction. In my free time, I lift weights and try out different board games and sports.
