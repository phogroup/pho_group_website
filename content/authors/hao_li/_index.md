Hao Li is a postdoctoral fellow of the Oden Institute at the University of Texas at Austin. His current research interest is about scientific machine learning and numerical analysis. Hao received his PhD in mathematics from Purdue University in 2021 and BSc from University of Science and Technology of China in 2016. During his PhD, he focused on numerical solution of PDE, especially the structure-preserving method and error estimate. The goal of Hao's research is to develop accurate, efficient and scalable algorithms solving problems from science and engineering with mathematical understanding.
