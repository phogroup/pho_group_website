Tri graduated with a B.Sc. in Petroleum Engineering in 2018, and a M.Sc. in Petroleum Engineering
in 2020 from Texas A & M University. In 2021, he began pursuing his PhD in Petroleum and
Geosystem Engineering (PGE) at The University of Texas at Austin while receiving the
Conocophillips Endowed Graduate Fellowship in Engineering. Tri is being co-advised by Dr. Quoc
Nguyen and Dr. Tan Bui-Thanh. His research objective is the development of a hybrid model to
characterize and predict fractured reservoirs dynamics. The hybrid model will be created by
leveraging the combination of existing model and available data. Subsequently, the optimal
integration of simulation model and monitoring data will compensate for the extensive
computational demands in comprehensive numerical simulation. The hybrid model aims to
maximize the value of hydraulic fracture architecture and surveillance information in oil and gas
exploration, enhanced geothermal systems, and carbon capture, utilization, and sequestration
(CCUS). Tri is currently exploring utilizing microseismic events data in combination with fractal
fracture network in the first hybrid model rendition.
