Nghia Nim is a rising junior at the New York University Abu Dhabi, U.A.E., pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Mathematics. He grew up in Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam, and has been pursuing research and studies in the U.S. and the U.A.E. at various NYU campuses, including the Tandon School of Engineering, School of Arts and Sciences, and NYU Abu Dhabi. His research interests lie primarily in machine learning and AI, with applications in solving forward and inverse problems in discrete dynamical systems and differential equations. Outside of work and studies, he enjoys playing the piano, rock-climbing, running, and learning languages (teach him your mother tongue)!
