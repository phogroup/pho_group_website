Hai Nguyen obtained his Bachelor's and Master's degree in Civil Engineering from the Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology, after which he worked as a graduate research assistant and teaching assistant at the same university. He is pursuing his Ph.D. in Aerospace Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin.

His current interests are in the broad areas of numerical analysis, scientific computing, and machine learning. He has developed the model-constrained deep learning approach for solving both challenging forward and inverse problems. He also has been working on solving time-dependent PDEs problems, i.e., Wave equation, Burger's equation, Navier-Stokes equation, using transformers architecture. He proposed a data-informed active subspace framework for solving inverse problems.
