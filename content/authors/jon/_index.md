# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: My research lies at the intersection of large scale distributed computing, deep learning, optimization, and inverse problems. Deep learning has recently been (ab)used to "solve" problems in scientific computing that it is fundamentally not well-suited for. Significant progress has been made over the last century to develop both the theory and practice of numerical methods to address challenges in the scientific community. Rather than disregarding the foundation from which the field of scientific computing is built, I seek to augment traditional methods with modern deep learning techniques to address computational challenges facing the scientific community today. In particular, I am interested in mathematically rigorous designs of machine learning systems to solve inverse problems and, when appropriate, using machine learning to replace expensive-to-compute parts of existing algorithms. One guiding principal in my work comes from [Google's remarks on the size and quality of a dataset](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/data-prep/construct/collect/data-size-quality): "Google has had great success training simple linear regression models on large data sets." With this in mind, I am interested in finding places where machine learning techniques can have the highest impact with low sensitivity to the complexity of the model. I am convinced that in many cases machine learning coupled with robust traditional numerical methods can lead to excellent results, enabling the solution to previously intractable problems.

# Jonathan is a PhD student studying the interface of machine learning and scientific computation. Specifically, he is interested in leveraging the fast inference capabilities of neural networks to accelerate the solution of inverse problems and provide uncertainty quantification for the results. To accomplish this, he is interested in deriving and applying rigorous mathematical theory for machine learning algorithms that justifies their use in scientific computation and provides guarantees of their effectiveness.
