I am currently working on reduced order models for dynamical systems. I am focused on methods which learn rules for evolving system dynamics in latent spaces of reduced dimensionality. It is my goal to develop novel approaches to solve challenging problems with decreased computation time. My passion is mathematics and its applications.
