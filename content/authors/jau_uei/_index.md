Jau-Uei obtained his bachelor degree from National Cheng Kung University in Taiwan. He brought his passion on Naval Architecture to the US while pursuing a master degree at the University of Michigan. He was especially interested in marine hydrodynamics. At the same time, he first learned how computation is involved in fluid dynamics, which can be applied to broader engineering problems and is not restricted to design oceanic vessels. The inspiration motivated him to take dual master degree in Aerospace, in which he gained further understanding in numerical methods via courseworks and also accumulated research experience in high order finite element methods. Jau-Uei completed his PhD degree in Engineering Mechanics at the University of Texas at Austin with a focus on high order finite element methods and high performance computing.  His research focused on designing a scalable numerical scheme that is well-suited for the modern computation architecture and can be applied to solve extreme large problems.
