Hi! I currently work on reduced order weather prediction (via neural operators). I'm interested in PINNs, L-Conv (Lie Groups), and other parametrized approaches that learn the smallest possible, arbitary resolution network. Usually these nets are promising surrogates or inverters for MCMC (markov-chain-monte-carlo) physics simulations. For fun, I enjoy creating procedural worlds/games, and compose music.
