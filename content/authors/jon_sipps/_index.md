Jonathan is a native Austinite who loves research and climbing! Graduating in 2017 with a Bachelor of
science in Aerospace Engineering, Jonathan moved on to work at The University of Texas at Austin:
Applied Research Laboratories (UT: ARL) with Dr. Lori Magruder for 3 years, assisting attitude estimation
for the Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2, a spaceborne lidar and flagship mission in remote
sensing to quantify land and sea ice mass change for global climate prediction. During his time at UT:
ARL, Jonathan volunteered out of interest to research the simulation of para- and ortho-hydrogen in 1D
relaxation and normal shocks for Dr. Philip Varghese. In 2020, Jonathan joined the UT: ASE graduate
school to research lidar validation techniques with Dr. Lori Magruder. In 2022, Jonathan won the NASA
Space Technology Graduate Research Opportunities (NSTGRO) national fellowship and is now co-advised
by Dr. Tan Bui. Jonathan is currently pursuing software and algorithm development for remote sensing
distributed spacecraft mission design.
