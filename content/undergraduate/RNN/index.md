## Brief Description

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) have shown to have remarkable capabilities when it
comes to modeling sequential data and have been at the forefront of research in time-series
forecasting problems in a variety of fields. First looking at RNNs with a mathematical focus,
we saw whether claims of model stability from published and unpublished papers could be
rigorously defended. We then investigate the practical abilities of RNNs through their implementation on certain systems of ordinary differential equations (ODE). We consider two
approaches of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network architectures for
predicting future time steps of solutions to first and second order ODEs as well as systems of
coupled ODEs to use as a guide for more complicated systems in the future.
