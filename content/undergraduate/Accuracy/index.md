### Brief Description

This project aims to answer the question: what are effective ways to improve a neural
network’s accuracy? A neural network was created to classify an individual's race according
to photos of their faces. This neural network’s performance was recorded after changing its
parameters to test how its accuracy is affected. This project also compares the results of
normal neural networks vs convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and using black and white
images vs RGB images. The results indicate that networks tend to perform better when there
are more epochs, more layers, and/or more training data. There appears to be neither much of
a difference in accuracy between normal neural nets and CNNs nor between black and white
and RGB images. The lack of improvement is most likely because the dataset is not very
diverse. However, this study did not cover all possible changes in parameter, so future studies
should attempt more possible permutations.
